                    <h2>What is a VT Shaped Student?</h2>
                    <p>Virginia Tech is a school known for its engineering, science, and business programs. However, there is much more to Tech than the sciences. There is a large emphasis placed on students getting a well-rounded education by taking classes in multiple disciplines, despite their major. Students are also encouraged to conduct their own reasearch while in school, get internships, or even study abroad. Not only that, but our moto is &ldquo;Ut Prosim,&rdquo; or &ldquo;that I may serve.&rdquo; Students are encouraged to go beyond their studies and out into the community and make a positive impact. Because of these things Virginia Tech students not only have a solid knowledge of their own dicipline, but also have a knowledge of many others, resulting in a better student and future employee.  </p>
                    
                    <h3>So, what do the V and T stand for?</h3> <img src="vtshapedstudentimg.jpg" alt="VT-Shaped Student Diagram">
                    
                    <h4>Understanding the V</h4>
                    <p><strong>The V places emphasis on experiential learning and student lead research.</strong><br>
                        Some of these opportunities include &ldquo;internships and education abroad, and First Year Experiences courses,&rdquo; as said on the <a herf="http://undergraduate.provost.vt.edu/vt-shaped-student.html">Virginia Tech website.</a> </p>
                        <p> Living-learning communities is one way Tech encourages students to further their learning outside of the classroom. These communities give students a chance to live with classmates studying the same dicipline as themselves. Students in these communities are provided with constant support and additional resources to help them achieve their goals. </p>
                        <p> Through exposure to opportunities outside of the classroom, Tech students gain experience that their peers at other schools may not have. This allows students to have an exceptional resume for when they apply for jobs and gives them a chance to connect with potential employers.
</p>
                <h4>Understanding the Vertical T</h4>
                    <p><strong>Virginia Tech students are consistently ranked at the top of their chosen fields.</strong><br> The vertical T stands for understanding of ones own discipline. Virginia Tech is known for outstanding academics and several programs are even top in the nation. According to <a herf="https://www.forbes.com/colleges/virginia-polytechnic-institute-and-state-university/"> Forbes </a> Tech is one of the top 25 public colleges in the nation. </p>
                    <p>The vertical T places emphasis on Tech students reaching their full potential in their chosen major. Employers recognize that Tech students are very good at what they do, and therefore many top companies come to recruit directly on campus. This gives students a greater chance of being hired in todays highly competitive job market.</p>
                    
                    <h4>Understanding the Horizontal T</h4>
                    <p><strong>Interdisciplinary studies allow students to have a broadened worldview and enhance their studies.</strong><br>Students who learn skills not only related to their major are much more marketable to future employers than those are who not exposed to new ways of thinking. </p>
                    <p>Virginia Tech is implementing Pathways to General Education in Fall 2018, revising the old General Education curriculum. This new program will require that all students take classes outside of their chosen disciplines, exposing them to new ideas they may never have considered. </p>
                    
                    <p>As stated on the <a herf="http://www.pathways.prov.vt.edu/1AboutPathways/AboutPathways.html" >Virginia Tech Pathways Website</a> this new curriculum is &ldquo;designed to guide students to examine the world from multiple perspectives and integrate their knowledge across disciplines and domains of learning through a hands-on, minds-on approach.&rdquo;
