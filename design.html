                 <h2>About My Design</h2>
                 <p>My idea for the design portion of this project was to create an interactive app that allows students to find fun, relevant events that pertain not only to their given major or minor, but also their individualized interests. My app, Hokie Hotspot, would help students become more VT-Shaped, without them even realizing it! </p>
                 <p>I think that the VT-Shaped Student is a great concept with many benefits to students future success, but I also feel as though most students will not actively try to peruse this ideal. In my opinion, the typical student finds initiatives such as this more as a gimmick than a model to be followed. This app masques the idea behind the façade of being an easy way to do fun things with your friends, when it reality it is helping the average student broaden their horizons, try new things, and become more of a VT Shaped Student.</p>
                 
                 <h3>Slides 1-3</h3>
                  <img src="2017-06-28%20(3).png" alt="Design Slide 1-3">
                  
             
                 <p>When students log into the app for the first time they are prompted to create a profile. This profile will have things such a major, minor, what organizations they are involved in, and their current career goals (such as looking for an internship or trying to find a full-time job). They will be instructed to input this information via dropdown boxes with a premade list of options for them to choose from, as you can see in slide 3. This information will help the app customize what events are shown to students. This ensures that the most relevant events are displayed first which will help lead to the success of this app.</p>
                 
                <h3>Slides 4-6</h3>
                <img src="slide%204.png" alt="Design Slide 4-6">
                
                <p>Slide 4 is a representation of what the basic profile will look like. There will be four different tabs each displaying different things. ‘My events’ will display events the student has already gone to and allow them to click the link taking them to the events page, ‘upcoming events’ will display events that the student has shown interesting in (this will also have links taking the student to the events page), ‘My friends’ will show events their chosen friends are going to, and ‘settings’ will allow them to update their preferences and information.</p>
                
                    <p>Slide 5 is one of the most important pages on the app. Students can search for specific events by simply typing it into a search bar, or they can search events by inserting a desired date, or they could simply scroll through all events and see which ones catch their eye. By clicking the more information link the student is take to a new page, slide 6, displaying a variety of information. </p>
                <p>There is an interactive map that will show the student their location in relation to the event, a list of what friends are attending, and even give them the ability to invite friends. The arrow will be used to show where the event is in relation to the student. There is a 'reserve' link that will add this event to the students saved events on their profile page. For every event displayed on the app there will be a brief section displaying why it is VT Shaped. </p>
                
                <h3>Slides 7-9</h3>
                <img src="slide%207%20(2).png" alt="Design Slide 7-9">
                
                <p>Slide 7 is what the basic interface for the ‘events for you’ section would look like. It would be very similar to the ‘upcoming events page,’ however, this page will use the students profile information to create a comprehensive list of upcoming events that are strictly related to the student’s needs. This will show events related to their major, minor, events going on by the organizations they are involved in, and events related to their career goals. This section will be able to help students go to information sessions about relevant internships or job opportunities and help them get involved in their chosen major. The more information link will take them to the same page as slide 7. On this page there is also a ‘why these events’ link that will tell the student this information and give them the ability to update their preferences in settings if they choose.</p>
                
                <p>Slide 8 is a very fun page with lots of options, in my opinion. By giving the student the ability to search for their friends and see what events they are interested in, they will be more likely to actually go to events if they know they will not be alone. This section gives them the option to invite a given friend to a certain event and view what events they have gone to in the past. There is the option to search for friends and add them to ‘my friends,’ as shown in the profile page. I envision the ‘find more friends’ link to allow students to connect this app with Facebook, Instagram, or twitter, so they can easily find all of their friends at once. This section can also be used to allow professors and students to connect and see what events the other is going to. This page also has another use, professors could create an event for a class, invite the students, and see who attended as part of their class grade.</p>
                
                <p>Slide 9 is the final section of this app. It is a page designed to inform students about what the VT Shaped Student is. The first two links will take the students to Virginia Tech webpages describing what a VT Shaped Student is, the pre-existing webpages could be used. The image I chose serves to inform the student about the model without them even having to click on anything due to the simple words describing what each aspect means. If the student wishes to know more all they would have to do is click the info buttons which would prompt a pop-up to display information about that section. </p>
                
                <h3>Slide 10</h3>
                <img src="slide%2010.png" alt="Design Slide 10">
                
                <p>The final feature of this app would be reminders that pop up on the students phone. When a student ‘reserves’ an event and adds it to their profile, a reminder will automatically be sent the day of the event to make sure the student remembers it. This feature will be useful because it will help keep attendance up and since it is an automatic feature there is no added work from the student.</p>
                
                <h3>Final Design Comments</h3>
                <p>Because this app shows not only events pertaining directly to a students major, but also shows them a variety of activities across campus, it encourages students to go outside of their chosen discipline and explore the entirety of Virginia Tech. This allows them to break down borders between different disciplines and gain greater understanding and respect for their fellow students in other fields. </p>
                
                <p></p>
                
                <p> By showing students community service opportunities, there may be a spike in our already outstanding attendance for those events. To me, one of the most important parts of the VT Shaped Student model is the community service aspect and living out our motto, Ut Prosim. Tech is known for having some of the biggest service events across the country such as Relay for Life, the biggest collegiate Relay in the world, and Big Event. This app would help students give back to the community, find a cause they are passionate about, and truly become a VT Shaped Student. </p>
                
                <p>These are just a few examples of how the app affirms the VT Shaped Student model, and I hope through my explanation of the app you saw the many other features that enable students to easily become a VT Shaped Student</p>
