                 <p>When students log into the app for the first time they are prompted to create a profile. This profile will have things such a major, minor, what organizations they are involved in, and their current career goals (such as looking for an internship or trying to find a full-time job). They will be instructed to input this information via dropdown boxes with a premade list of options for them to choose from, as you can see in slide 3. This information will help the app customize what events are shown to students. This ensures that the most relevant events are displayed first which will help lead to the success of this app.</p>
                 
                <h3>Slides 4-6</h3>
                <img src="slide%204.png" alt="Design Slide 4-6">
                
                <p>Slide 4 is a representation of what the basic profile will look like. There will be four different tabs each displaying different things. ‘My events’ will display events the student has already gone to and allow them to click the link taking them to the events page, ‘upcoming events’ will display events that the student has shown interesting in (this will also have links taking the student to the events page), ‘My friends’ will show events their chosen friends are going to, and ‘settings’ will allow them to update their preferences and information.</p>
                
                <p>Slide 5 is one of the most important pages on the app. Students can search for specific events by simply typing it into a search bar, or they can search events by inserting a desired date, or they could simply scroll through all events and see which ones catch their eye. By clicking the more information link the student is take to a new page, slide 6, displaying a variety of information. There is an interactive map that will show the student their location in relation to the event, a list of what friends are attending, and even give them the ability to invite friends. There is a 'reserve' link that will add this event to the students saved events on their profile page. For every event displayed on the app there will be a brief section displaying why it is VT Shaped. </p>
