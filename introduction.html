                    <h1>Who am I</h1>

                    <p>My name is Kirby Tucker and I am currently an upcoming junior at Virginia Tech. You can learn a little more about me in the interests tab, if you choose!</p>
                    
                    <h2>My Digital Writing Experience</h2>
                    
                    <p>This is my first time being exposed to any sort of digital writing and coding. My first reaction when learning that I had to take a class that involved coding was that of terror. <img src="panic.gif" alt="Panic Gif" style="width: 150px; height:100px;" align="left" hspace="10" vspace="10"/> My relationship with technology is a very limited one. I know how to do what I need to do on the computer and that is essentially it. Upon getting into the class, however, I am glad to say that it is not as difficult as I thought it may be. I am very excited to be learning the basics of creating digital media, as it is the main method of communication in modern society. <br></p>
                    
                    
                    
                    <p><h2>My Feelings About the VT-Shaped Student Concept</h2>
                    
                    <p>I personally appreciate the VT-Shaped Student Concept. I like how this program allows Tech students to be exposed to disciplines they may never have studied on their own. I am in agreement that this program creates a more well-rounded individual who has more skills than if they were not to participate in this curriculum. </p>
                    
                    <p>I try to live as a VT-Shaped Student. I am majoring in two different colleges and am working towards two completely different degrees. I believe that doing this greatly expands my knowledge and relevant skill set. What I am not learning in one major, I can learn in another. Being an interdisciplinary student allows me to be more marketable for future employers since I have a wider variety of skills.</p>
                    
                    <p>One other impoortant aspect of being a VT-Shaped Student is community service and living out Tech's motto of Ut Prosim. To me, this is the most important aspect of the model besides being an interdisciplinary student. Being involved in ones community allows you to make connections with a whole new group of people, while making a positive impact. I live this out by being on committee for Relay for Life. Community service brings the Tech community together and makes individuals better people.</p>
