                <h2>About My Podcast</h2>
                <h3>My Stance on a T Shaped Student</h3>
                <p>It is clear from my podcast that I am in favor of not only the VT Shaped Student initiative, but also the T Shaped Student theory. I have heard time and time again from recruiters and professionals that most modern students lack skills such as paper writing and effective communication. The T Shaped Student theory strives to fix this problem and ensure students have all the necessary skills to succeed in the workplace. A few of the reasons I am in favor of this idea are:
                <li>You gain more knowledge than traditional schooling</li>
                <li>You become more marketable for future job applications</li>
                <li>You gain more respect and appreciation for other disciplines </li>
                </p>
                <h3>My Design</h3>
                <p>I designed my podcast to flow into about four main sections that break down the different facets of a T Shaped Student at Virginia Tech. They are as follows:
                <li>What is a T Shaped Student?</li>
                <li>Parts of the T</li>
                <li>A T Shaped Studnet at Tech</li>
                <li>How do you become T Shaped?</li>
                </p>
                <p>By breaking the podcast into four main parts, the podcast is easy to follow and has all the vital information for someone just learning about the T Shaped Student model. </p>
                
               <h3>To Recap</h3>
              <img src="tshaped.png" alt="T Shaped Student Diagram">
              <p>There are two main aspects designed to maximize student learning potential during their relatively brief time at school. These two main features can even be further broken down into two subsections, as shown in the model above. </p>
              <p>The horizontal part of the T represents interdisciplinary skills, understanding of different software, and effective communication across disciplines. </p>
              <p>The vertical part of the T represents the main reason most students went to school, which is their disciplinary skills. These are the skills that will initially get the student hired for things such as, internships and externships, and full time jobs.  </p>
              
             <h3>Why Does it Matter?</h3>
             <p>In the workplace, it is vital for students to have the proper skills pertaining to their chosen discipline. Some people believe this is the only reason to go to school, but they could not be further from the truth. Without the interdisciplinary skills needed in a real-life environment, student will lack the ability to effectively communicate vital company information, work efficiently in teams, or even create proper reports. This will prevent students from succeeding in the workplace and could slow their potential future promotions. </p>
             <p>The T Shaped Student theory remedies this problem, and more. This model ensures students are well versed in these skills that will help them succeed in the office. Even more than that, the T Shaped Student theory allows students to explore other disciplines that they would have never considered before. This broadens students horizons and allows them to discover new things that may become a passion of theirs later on in life. My podcast touches on this by providing examples of what unique skills come along with being a T Shaped Student in the How do you become T Shaped section towards the end of the episode.</p>
